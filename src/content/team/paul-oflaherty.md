His primary objective is to offer exceptional advisory services to businesses seeking to enhance their operations through system improvements and/or integrations. By identifying and addressing issues where individuals, processes, and technology intersect it is possible to simplify business operations and improve the effectiveness of management.

Throughout his career, Paul has held various leadership positions, including IT Director for Sharp Business Systems. During his tenure, he played a pivotal role in the company’s growth, expanding from a small team of five to over 1,000 employees and increasing revenues from zero to $220 million, primarily through strategic acquisitions.
 
Following his departure from Sharp, Paul joined Konica Minolta as a Consulting Manager, responsible for deploying SAP Business One ERP systems into the Office Technology Dealer market. In this capacity, he and his team successfully implemented ERP solutions for a dozen Dealers.
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Paul assumed the role of Managed IT Consultant at CEO Juice, supporting the company for four months while they developed and implemented software to synchronize financial data from ConnectWise Manage into the ECi eAutomate system, a widely used platform by Office Equipment Dealers. During this period, the concept for Infinite Limit | Business Services emerged, and our first client joined us after Paul’s departure from CEO Juice in March 2021."
